### Options

Biq Blue copy `JOBS` and `TABLES` rows from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` in all available projects.

#### Temporary tables

By default, Biq uses temporary tables. This is the simplest way to start but the downside is that tables expire after 24 hours.

#### Permanent tables

If you use Biq Blue every day you should consider the option of creating a dataset just for it: Biq will create tables in this dataset with 3 main benefits:
- tables never expired and Biq will only copy the latest rows from `INFORMATION_SCHEMA` into these tables
- tables can be shared for your own queries or dashboard if needed (API)
- you can activate the automatic hourly update to always have fresh data
