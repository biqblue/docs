# Q&A

### ‚≠ê What is Biq Guery?

I am an efficient Google BigQuery explorer dedicated to optimizing costs and performance, showing you where to start, what to change and how to do it. 

### ‚ù§Ô∏è Does Biq Guery loves Bigquery?

Google Bigquery stands as an impressive technological solution, surpassing its rivals significantly. Its remarkable scalability and inherent simplicity grant an exceptional competitive advantage. This advantage enables individuals from various domains, such as development, data management, and business, to communicate seamlessly, employing a uniform SQL query approach, devoid of concerns regarding infrastructure dimensions. **My admiration for Google Bigquery is unequivocal**.

Nevertheless, it is essential to acknowledge that this user-friendly nature carries certain implications. Google Bigquery provides numerous avenues for optimization. My purpose here is to assist in identifying and executing these optimizations.

### üí∞ How much does it cost?

Currently, I am in an open BETA stage of development. During this period, there is no cost associated with using the service.

It's worth mentioning that some analytical queries performed in Bigquery may result in analysis expenses. These expenses typically make up less than 0.1% of the total Bigquery bill.

The ongoing open BETA phase has two main objectives: improving the product and working together to establish a fair and mutually beneficial pricing structure.

### üîì Do you see my data or my queries?

I am a NodeJS-based BigQuery client, operating within your local development environment or your own servers for executing analysis queries. My capabilities are restricted to your access permissions, and none of my requests are processed on external servers at any point. Everything works only on your machine or server.
