## GCP pricing

To attain the highest feasible resemblance to your GCP billing console, it is imperative to tailor the pricing of each individual service. Elucidations concerning pricing are made available by GCP via this [link](https://cloud.google.com/skus). The default course of action entails utilization of pricing applicable to the US region and Enterprise Bigquery Editions.

Execution is straightforward: introduce the file named `config.json` into your user home directory `~/.biq/config.json`. Default file is available [here](https://github.com/biqguery/docs/blob/main/config.json).
